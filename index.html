			<p class="intro"> Earlier this NBA season, on November 6 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Brooklyn Nets Guard Cam Thomas scored 45 points. It was the fifth time in his career he scored 40 points or more in a game. The 22 year-old had played just 2,363 career minutes before doing so.

            <p>  This list (compiled from these <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/highest-career-ppg-by-active-players"target="_blank">two</a> data <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_per_g_career.html" target="_blank">    sources</a>) includes some of the greatest scorers in NBA history, such as LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille Oâ€™Neal. None of these players, other than Micheal Jordan, recorded 5 40-point games quicker into their careers than Cam Thomas. In fact, for many of these scoring legends, it took two, three, or four times as many career minutes as Thomas to achieve the same feat.
